# BrawlCore

This is a plugin which takes care of almost everything on BrawlKits. (except Discord stuff since it would take 1 trillion years to upload & compile)

Look wherever you want, if you see anything that can be improved I'll open a PR, and I'll be happy to approve it.

## How to compile?

This plugin uses Gradle, so to compile it you can either:
- Use `.\gradlew.bat shadowJar` (or `gradlew shadowJar` if you're on Linux)
-
